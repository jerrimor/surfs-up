# Surfs-Up Challenge

## Project Summary
This project is to determine the feasibility of opening up a surf and shake shop in Oahu by analyzing the weather data for this location.  Statistics are gathered using SQLAlchemy, sqlite and pandas libraries.  Using a weather dataset, Jupyter notebook and a SQLite database the weather statistics will be run and analyzed.  Within the challenge specifcally, the months of June and December are focused on to provide a complete overview so that the investor can decide if Oahu is a good location for the shop. 

## Results
The statistics for the challenge, in June and December, are listed below.

Three key differences in weather between June and December are
1. The minimum temperature between the two months is quite different.  The minimun in June is 64 while the minimum in December is 56.  That difference of eight degrees is significant as the analysis is to understand whether or not people would want ice cream and/or to be in the ocean to surf.  There is a decent gap between the two however a minimum of 56 is not detrimental to an environment for surfing. 
2. The count of days for temperatures is about 200 less for December than in June.  June is at 1700 days and December is just over 1500. Although there isn't an equal amount of days for evaulating the temperature statistics, the mean and medians can be deduced and are helpful. 
3. A third difference that should be considered is the 25% temperature value. For June the value is 73 and for December it is 69.  The difference is only 4 but it is less in December.  The overall impact of the success of this project may not be affected by this minimal difference but it is worth noting to W. Avy, the investor.  


## Overview
The weather on Oahu is mild with temperatures in the low 70's in both winter and summer.  The temperature remains consistently warm which is important for a business who wants their customers to be in need of something cool, like ice cream and to hope their customers feel warm enough to be in the water to surf.
